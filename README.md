# Python-Project-2
## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a simple alarm clock application that allows users to:

 - Set an alarm at a specific time.
 - View and store past alarms.
 - Play an alarm sound when the set time is reached.
 - Stop the alarm when desired.
## This project will help you understand how to:

 - Work with Tkinter for GUI development.
 - Handle time-based events in Python.
 - Use multithreading for background tasks (alarm checking).
 - Play audio with Pygame.
## Expected Outcome
### Upon successful completion, the following outcomes should be achieved:

  - Set an Alarm: The user can input a specific time (in HH:MM format) to set an alarm.
 - Current Time Display: The current time is displayed and continuously checked against the alarm time.
 - Alarm Notification: When the current time matches the set alarm time, the alarm rings (using sound).
 - Stop Alarm: The user can stop the alarm sound at any time.
 - Past Alarms List: A window will display all the previously set alarm times.
